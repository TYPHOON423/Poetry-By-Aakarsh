<h1> Best Friend </h1>
<p class="p1"> You were there for me <br>

Whenever there was a fuss. <br>

But now you are a mess <br>

For me...... <br>
<br>


We used to be together <br>

During all weathers. <br>

But now we rarely gather <br>

For each other. <br>
<br>


I used to matter, <br>

But now I'm just a rather <br>

I'm just shattered <br>

And your thoughts are just a hazard <br>

For me....... <br>
<br>


The songs we sang, <br>

The secrets we shared, <br>

The way you cared <br>

Still you left me blank. <br>
<br>


I hate those assholes <br>

I hate those fuckers <br>

I hate those devils <br>

Who took you away <br>

From me....... <br>
<br>


I just pray <br>

To revive our way <br>

And relive the old days. <br>
<br>


I just miss you <br>

My best friend.</p>
