<h1> Only You </h1>
<p class="p1"> 
There was one <br>
who had me won. <br>
The greatest of all <br>
It was her, but none. <br>
<br>

Her brown eyes, <br>
That had me sinking <br>
everytime I looked into them. <br>
And ahh, the pretty face that made me drunk. <br>
<br>

There was a smile, <br>
That had me stuck for quite a while. <br>
And then there was me <br>
Nowhere near her, was all I could see. <br>
<br>

Thank God she wasn't a judge <br>
I was accepted, the way I was. <br>
As our friendship grew, <br>
There were some who couldn't see us. <br>
<br>

And then came the day, <br>
A line between us drew its way. <br>
For the sake of fading the line away <br>
I had to say,"Ay, it's only you, but none." <br>
