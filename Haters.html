<h1> Haters </h1>
<p class="p1"> When you grow, when you fly <br>
There are people who always try <br>
To make you fall or atleast cry. <br>
<br>

They try their best <br>
To become a pest <br>
In your life so stressed. <br>
<br>

Some do it 'cause they're messed <br>
Others for they're unimpressed <br>
Few 'cause they can't contest. <br>
<br>

They generate many hurdles <br>
And make you do lot'o reversals <br>
But success is incomplete without their journals. <br>
<br>

They are the debaters, <br>
who help fill our craters. <br>
So, it is good to have some haters. <br>
